# MD-FED

Recognizing fine-grained sports events with precise temporal localization is essential for sports analytics but remains challenging due to factors such as rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences, often requiring large amounts of labeled data. Existing end-to-end visual and skeleton-based models struggle in few-shot scenarios due to their reliance on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. We propose Multimodal Distillation for Few-Shot Fine-Grained Event Detection (MD-FED), a weakly supervised approach that leverages skeleton-based features as a teacher to guide student networks in learning visual representations from RGB and optical flow. MD-FED employs a three-stage training strategy: skeleton-based pretraining, multimodal distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning. Evaluations on four sports datasets—F3Set, ShuttleSet, FineGym, and Figure Skating—demonstrate that MD-FED significantly outperforms single-modality models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for fine-grained sports action detection.
